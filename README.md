# Random-Forest-Project-and-Decision-Tree-Model
For this Project I explored publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). 

As an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.

I used lending data from 2007-2010(publically available) to classify and predict if the borrower paid back their loan in full or not.
